walkmod-rawfiles-plugin
=======================

Walkmod plugin to process raw files (without parsing).

== Usage 

Specifically, this plugin allows to work with the string content of a file. Specifically, it has been designed to rewrite files for an 
specific platform (e.g unix, mac or windows) and thus, work with an specific an endline char (\n, \r or \r\n).


In order to use this plugin from a project where you would like to run walkmod, you just need to add:

  </plugins>
  ...
</walkmod>
```

2) The configuration provider specifying your classpath (the project .classes and the dependencies)

```XML
<!DOCTYPE walkmod PUBLIC "-//WALKMOD//DTD"  "http://www.walkmod.com/dtd/walkmod-1.1.dtd" >
